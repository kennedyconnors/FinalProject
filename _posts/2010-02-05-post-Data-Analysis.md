> Welcome to the data analysis section! Today we are looking at the economy and efficiency of Jim, during his cycling. The goal was to analyze the relationship between power output and oxygen uptake, overall to determine the gross cycling efficiency of Jim during an incremental ergometry cycling test.

> Here is his data

> Taking a look at this spread sheet we can come up with some conclusions

> Figure 1 shows that when the power output is increased every four minutes, oxygen uptake is also increased; however, there isn't a direct linear relationship since both increased in different proportions. In such a relationship, the amount of oxygen required by working muscles and tissues increases as exercise intensity or resistance increases, but once the required amount is received, it remains relatively stagnant until the output is once again increased.

> Figure 2 shows a similar relationship with the gross cycling efficiency and power output. In this relationship as the power output increased in increments, the gross efficiency increased with it, suggesting that gross efficiency improves with increased power output, even when work rates are relatively low.
